## Project Background
We currently have a dataset containing 118 searchable keywords of both common and scientific botanical names of edible vegetables and fruits. Using the list of scientific names, we need 1 visual representation of each vegetable or fruit to build an image-based detection model.

I've compiled the dataset into aÂ .csv and made it available for downloads on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/dianoctaviani/scientific-botanical-names-of-fruits-vegetables
